     <p>-As an ICT student in MSU-MSAT, i plan to apply what i have learned in my 
     future strand in senior high school.I am an aspiring Nurse, inspired and determined
     to help the lives of those in need. A sport i enjoy playing is badminton, i also plan to
     excel and improve in this sport."You'll never know, if you never try", a motto that i stand by.
     A simple phrase meaning there is no harm in trying and that you may succeed if you try,
     and if you do fail, it is only another lesson for you to learn.</p>
